Since I'm already a Linux user(Fedora), i didnt install it on a virtual machine, I've been using 
linux as my primary driver for at least 2-3 years now. 
Today's task helped me brush up on my old knowledge. This has improved my understanding of Linux and Linux environment
on how to harden os and to understanding OS-level security
